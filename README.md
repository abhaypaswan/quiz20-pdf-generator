## Project: PDF generator for Quiz20

**Objective:**
The primary motivation behind the development of this project is to address the challenge of limited support for local languages, such as Hindi, in the Flutter framework. The project aims to provide a workaround by leveraging Python's ReportLab library to dynamically generate PDFs, facilitating seamless content presentation in local languages.

**Usage Scenario:**
This project is tailored to address a specific requirement in a localized context, making it ideal for scenarios where native language support is crucial. This project may not be applicable to a broader audience but serves as a valuable solution for my Quiz20 App.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Frontend:** Flutter
* **Backend:** Python, Flask, ReportLab (for PDF creation)
* **Deployment:** Cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS Lambda)

**End-to-End Process:**

**1. Flutter App:**

* User enters data in the app.
* App sends data to Flask API via HTTP request (e.g., POST).
* App displays progress indicator while waiting for response.
* Upon receiving response:
    * If success:
        * Display download link or trigger download process.
    * If error:
        * Display error message to user.

**2. Flask API:**

* Receives data from Flutter app.
* Uses ReportLab to generate PDF with user data.
* Stores the PDF file (optional, depending on deployment).
* Sends response to Flutter app:
    * If success:
        * Include download link or initiate download.
    * If error:
        * Include error message.

**3. Deployment:**

* Deploy the Flask app to a cloud platform.
* Configure the Flutter app to connect to the deployed API endpoint.

**Database (Optional):**

* Database can be used to:
    * Store user data (optional).
    * Track generated PDFs and download history.

**Deployment Options:**

* Heroku: Free platform for deploying web applications.
* AWS Lambda: Serverless platform for deploying code without managing servers.
* DigitalOcean App Platform: Simple and scalable platform for deploying web applications.

**Additional Notes:**

* Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS for communication between app and API.
* Implement error handling and logging throughout the application.
* Consider using a tool like `gunicorn` to manage the Flask application in production.

**Next steps:**

* Choose a specific deployment platform.
* Implement the API endpoints in Flask.
* Develop the Flutter app and integrate API calls.
* Configure deployment and test the entire flow.
